After the divine Liturgy, with the Priest standing in the Sanctuary, those who are to be joined take their stand before the Holy Doors, with the man on the right and the woman on the left. On the right side of the Holy Table are placed their two rings, one of gold and the other of silver. The silver one towards the right and the gold towards the left, close to each other. The Priest, having come into the narthex, signs the heads of those who are to be married three times and gives them lighted candles. He leads them into the Church and censes in the form of a cross.

By a ring authority was given to Joseph in Egypt. By a ring Daniel was glorified in the country of Babylon. By a ring the truth of Thamar was revealed. By a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion to the prodigal son. For he said, ‘Put a ring on his hand and bring out and slay the fatted calf, and let us eat and be joyful’. It was your right hand, Lord, that armed Moses at the Red Sea, for through your true word the heavens were made firm and the earth set on its foundations. And the right hand of your servants will be blessed by your mighty word and by your upraised arm. Therefore, Master, with your heavenly blessing now bless also this putting-on of rings. And may an Angel of the Lord go before them all the days of their lives. For you are the One who blesses and sanctifies all things, and to you we give glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

%<*"p0141a">
Blessed are you, Lord our God, sacred Celebrant of the mystical and most pure marriage, Lawgiver of bodily marriage, Guardian of incorruption, loving Steward of our livelihood. In the beginning, Master, you fashioned man and established him as king of creation, and said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone on the earth. Let us make him a helper like himself.’ And taking one of his ribs you fashioned a woman. When Adam saw her he said, ‘Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. She will be called ‘woman’ because she was taken from her man. For this reason a man will leave behind his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’. And ‘Those whom God has joined together, let no human separate’. Now, Master, Lord our God, send down your heavenly grace also on these servants of yours, N. and M., and grant that this handmaid of yours may be subject in all things to her husband and that this servant of yours may be the head of his wife, so that they may live in accordance with your will.

Brethren, give thanks at all times for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, making yourselves subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is head of the wife, as Christ too is head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body. But as the Church is subject to Christ, so wives must be also to their own husbands in everything. Husbands love your own wives, as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for her, that he might sanctify her, having purified her with the washing of water with a word, that he might present the Church to himself glorious, without spot or wrinkle or anything similar, but that she might be holy and unblemished. Thus husbands must love their own wives like their own bodies. One who loves his own wife loves himself, for no one hates their own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as the Lord does the Church, because we are members of his body, from his flesh and from his bones. ‘For this reason a man will abandon his father and mother and be attached to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ This is a great mystery, I mean concerning Christ and the Church. However let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife respect her husband.

At that time, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage. When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, ‘They have no wine’. Jesus said to her. ‘Woman, why do you trouble me? My hour has not yet come.’ His mother said to the servants, ‘Whatever he tells you, do it.’ Now there were six stone water jars standing there for the Jewish ritual of purification, holding twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the jars with water.’ And they filled them to the brim. He said to them, ‘Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward of the feast. They took it. When the chief steward tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it had come from — but the servants who had drawn the water knew — he summoned the bridegroom and said to him, ‘Everyone puts out the good wine first, and when people are drunk, then he puts out the worse. But you have kept the good wine until now.’ This was the beginning of the signs that Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and he manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him.

Ruling of Nikephoros, Patriarch of Constantinople, the Confessor.
%</"p0334">
%<*"p0335">
One who marries for a second time is not crowned, but is forbidden to partake of the most pure Mysteries for two years; but one who marries for a third time for five.
%</"p0335">
%<*"p0336">
From the answers of the blessed Niketas, Metropolitan of Herakleia, to the questions of Bishop Constantine.
%</"p0336">
%<*"p0337">
Strictness did not permit those who married for a second time to be crowned, and the custom of the Great Church does not disregard such things, but nevertheless bestows marriage crowns on those who marry for a second and on those who do so for a third time. They are however forbidden to receive Holy Communion for one or two years. But the Priest who has celebrated their wedding is not allowed to dine with them, in accordance with the 7th canon of the Synod of Neoceasarea.

Master, Lord our God, who spare all and foresee all, who know the secrets of humans and have knowledge of all, be merciful to our sins and pardon the offences of your suppliants, calling them to repentance, granting them pardon of faults, mercy for sins, forgiveness of offences, voluntary and involuntary. You, our Fashioner and Creator, who know the weakness of human nature; who pardoned Rahab the harlot and accepted the Publican’s repentance, do not remember our sins of ignorance since our youth. If you, Lord, should mark iniquities: O Lord, who will stand? What flesh will be justified in your presence? For you alone are just, without sin, holy, great in mercy, great in compassion and repent over the sins of humankind. Do you, Master, who have made your servants,

Lord Jesus Christ, who were lifted up on the precious and life-giving Cross, tore up the record against us and delivered us from the dominion of the devil, be merciful to the iniquities of your servants, because they, unable to bear the heat and burden of the day and the burning fever of the flesh, are now entering together the communion of a second marriage, as you made it lawful through the Apostle Paul, your vessel of election, saying for the sake of us in our lowliness, ‘It is better to marry in the Lord, than to burn’. As you are good and love mankind, have mercy, pardon, show pity, remit, forgive our debts, for you took our sicknesses on your own shoulders, for no one is sinless or without stain, not even were their life but one day, but you alone, who wore flesh without sin and granted us eternal dispassion.
